			When it first appeared at the Seventh Avenue Armory several years ago, the Tribal Art Fair was a polycultural continent unto itself. After the Armory became unavailable, the fair dissolved into an archipelago of individual shows scattered across town. Now re-established by the art dealer Maureen Zarember and renamed Tribal Art New York, it’s convening again, in smaller form, with more than a dozen galleries gathered in the wood-paneled rooms of the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion on the Upper East Side.

			"Sotheby's African and Oceanic art department in New York welcomes Maureen Zarember's initiative with AOA New York , an international art fair surrounding the important auctions of Modern and Contemporary art, as we believe it satisfies the increasing demand of collectors in this rapidly growing field"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Every year in May, the world's most important art collectors gather in New York to attend the auctions of Modern and Impressionist art. The cross-over between collectors of Modern and Contemporary art and African and Oceanic art is long established and very significant. Sotheby's New York has strategically chosen May as the date for its important sales of African and Oceanic art, and re-established New York City as one of the two important international centers for sales of African and Oceanic art"

			"The AOA fair of May 2011 was a sophisticated and convivial event which elegantly fulfilled a necessary niche for collectors within the New York marketplace for the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. AOA 2012 promises more of the same."

			"The AOA NY 2011 fair was extremely successful for us.  Because of the more intimate setting of the Fletcher-Sinclair Mansion at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue rather than a cavernous armory venue, it was our impression it allowed clients to envision how pieces would look in their own environments." 
		</p>
		<p>
			"We met (and sold to) many new clients from the United States and Europe and reconnected with several old clients whom we had not seen for a few years. We brought top-rate museum quality objects in order to emphasize that this level of material is not only available but also very affordable, particularly vis-à-vis to contemporary paintings and such.  Significant museum curators visited the show, which is always extremely important."
